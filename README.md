# MERN STACK STARTER KIT

Project Title: HUMANS OF NEW YORK (BLOG SITE)

Project Description: Welcome to "Humans of New York (blog site)", an immersive online platform inspired by the popular "Humans of New York" series. Our platform seeks to capture and share the diverse, poignant, and often inspiring stories of everyday individuals in our city. Through narratives, we aim to highlight the beauty of diversity and the common threads that unite us all.

This application provides a user-friendly platform for users to share their personal stories and experiences through a rich, visually engaging interface. Users can create posts to share their story. Visitors can engage with these stories by reading them and hopefully be inspired to join our community.

In developing "Humans of New York (blog site)", I have used a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Zustand and Node.js) for a number of reasons. Firstly, the JavaScript-based stack ensures efficient and seamless development process. Secondly, React and Zustand enables a responsive, interactive user interface, while Express and Node.js provide a robust and scalable backend. MongoDB offers flexibility in storing text-based content.

Throughout the development process, I encountered several challenges. Handling image uploads and ensuring they seamlessly integrate with the user's text content was a significant task.

Looking ahead, I plan to implement several enhancements to "Humans of New York (blog site)". These include a comment section, means to upload photos and videos, and incorporate weekly announcements concerning how you can engage in fun activities together around the city.

I hope "Humans of New York" will serve as a digital canvas for the people of our city to share their stories, fostering empathy, understanding, and connection within our community. I invite you to explore, engage, and be inspired by the faces and stories of our city.
